# Age-Calculator
An age calculator is a simple yet useful tool that computes a person's age based on their date of birth and the current date. This can be done programmatically using various programming languages. In this explanation, we'll use Python to demonstrate the methodology, steps, and implementation of an age calculator.

## Methodology
The basic methodology involves the following steps:

1 Input Collection: Collect the date of birth from the user.
2 Current Date Retrieval: Retrieve the current date.
3 Age Calculation: Calculate the difference between the current date and the date of birth to determine the age.
4 Edge Case Handling: Handle edge cases such as leap years and date validation.

## Implementation Steps: 
1 Input Collection: We need to collect the date of birth from the user. This typically includes the year, month, and day.
2 Current Date Retrieval: We use Python's datetime module to get the current date.
3 Age Calculation: We calculate the age by finding the difference between the current date and the date of birth. We need to consider the year, month, and day separately to handle edge cases correctly.
4 Edge Case Handling:
    Handle cases such as:
    The user entering a future date.
    The user entering an invalid date format.
